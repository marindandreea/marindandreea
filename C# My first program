//First of all, i am using Visual Studio 2019 on an Windows PC (there are a couple of differences on Mac)
using System; //i want to use the namespace called System
//namespace System has a bunch of different classes,
//include a lot of details like "what a Console is?" etc

namespace paw1 //i am creating my own namespace called paw1
{
    class Program //by default
    {
        //entry point of my program
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //compared to C++, Concole.WriteLine(); is equivalent to cout<< <<endl;
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
            Console.WriteLine("This is my first program in C# :D");
            /*if you need to run my .exe (without this script in Visual Studio)
            the terminal will close straight away*/
            //to manage that, i choose to read "nothing", using Console.Read();
            Console.Read();
            //now the .exe will close when i press one key (doesn't matter which key) 
        }
    }
}
